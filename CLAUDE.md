# Sygaldry Development Context

## Project Overview

This is a Sygaldry AI framework project that provides reusable components for LLM-powered applications.

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.12+
- **LLM Framework**: Mirascope v2.0.0-alpha.1
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic
- **Component System**: Sygaldry Registry
- **Observability**: Lilypad (optional)

## Development Principles

### Mirascope v2 Best Practices

1. **Functional Prompts**: Functions return formatted prompt strings (f-strings) instead of using `@prompt_template` decorators
2. **Format Models**: Use `format=` parameter (replaces `response_model=`) for structured LLM outputs
3. **Provider Specification**: Use full provider syntax (e.g., `provider="openai:completions"`)
4. **Model ID**: Use `model_id=` parameter (replaces `model=`)
5. **Function-Based Tools**: Use `@llm.tool` decorated functions instead of `BaseTool` classes
6. **Async Patterns**: Continue using `async def` for all LLM calls and tools
7. **Multi-Provider**: Support OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.
8. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive validation and error recovery

### Component Architecture

- Each component has a `component.json` manifest
- Components can depend on other registry components
- Include comprehensive documentation and examples
- Follow semantic versioning

### Code Quality Standards

- Type hints for all function parameters and returns
- Google-style docstrings
- Comprehensive unit tests
- PEP 8 code formatting
- Proper logging and error handling

## Common Patterns (Mirascope v2)

### Basic Agent Structure

```python
from mirascope import llm
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class ResponseModel(BaseModel):
    answer: str = Field(..., description="The answer to the question")
    confidence: float = Field(..., description="Confidence score 0-1")

@llm.call(provider="openai:completions", model_id="gpt-4o-mini", format=ResponseModel)
def my_agent(question: str) -> str:
    """Answer questions with confidence scoring."""
    return f"""You are a helpful assistant. Answer this question concisely and provide a confidence score.

Question: {question}

Provide your answer and a confidence score between 0 and 1."""
```

### Tool Implementation

```python
from mirascope import llm

@llm.tool
def search_web(query: str, max_results: int = 5) -> str:
    """Search the web for information.

    Args:
        query: The search query
        max_results: Maximum number of results to return

    Returns:
        Search results as formatted text
    """
    # Implementation here
    return "search results"
```

### Agent with Tools

```python
from mirascope import llm
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class SearchResult(BaseModel):
    answer: str = Field(..., description="Answer based on search results")
    sources: list[str] = Field(..., description="Source URLs used")

@llm.call(
    provider="openai:completions",
    model_id="gpt-4o-mini",
    format=SearchResult,
    tools=[search_web]
)
def research_agent(question: str) -> str:
    """Research questions using web search."""
    return f"""You are a research assistant with access to web search.

Question: {question}

Use the search_web tool to find relevant information, then provide a comprehensive answer with sources."""
```
