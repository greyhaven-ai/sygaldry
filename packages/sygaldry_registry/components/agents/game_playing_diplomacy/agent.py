    Diplomacy is a game of negotiation, strategy, and betrayal where seven Great Powers
    vie for control of Europe. Success requires both tactical military planning and
    diplomatic finesse.

    Key Strategic Principles:
    1. Geography is destiny - understand supply lines and chokepoints
    2. Alliances are temporary - all players ultimately compete
    3. Timing is crucial - know when to cooperate and when to betray
    4. Balance of power - prevent any player from growing too strong
    5. Diplomatic leverage - use position to extract concessions

    Analyze the current position considering:
    - Supply center distribution and growth potential
    - Military position and unit placement
    - Diplomatic relationships and trust levels
    - Strategic opportunities and threats
    - Long-term winning paths
