    Catan is a game of resource management, strategic building, and trading where

    Key Strategic Principles:
    1. Resource diversity - access to all five resources
    2. High-probability numbers - 6 and 8 are most frequent
    3. Port access - enables better trading ratios
    4. Expansion paths - plan where to grow
    5. Blocking opponents - deny key spots and resources
    6. Development cards - hidden victory points and strategic advantages

    Victory Points:
    - Settlement: 1 point
    - City: 2 points
    - Longest Road (5+ roads): 2 points
    - Largest Army (3+ knights): 2 points
